cross entropy:
KL divergence:

how to validate the data generation:
1. the total timestamp for convergence(validated within the training process) which is affected by a. the algorithm; b. the states variables; c. the reward function;
  --> reward function too general, slow/ too specific, lost the sense of generality and not possible for other environment
2. the success rate(validated on the test dataset) 
    overfit if the reward too specific? 
    test dataset should made by manual input.

how to improve the data generation process?
1. actually there is
