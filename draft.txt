cross entropy:
KL divergence:

how to validate the data generation:
1. the total timestamp for convergence(validated within the training process) which is affected by a. the algorithm; b. the states variables; c. the reward function;
  --> reward function too general, slow/ too specific, lost the sense of generality and not possible for other environment
2. the success rate(validated on the test dataset) 
    overfit if the reward too specific? 
    test dataset should made by manual input.

how to improve the data generation process?
1. actually there is no need to save the data in a local file
2. data collection: initialization is of great importance? --> ask different particicants to record their operations.



Environment assumption:
    constant height + flat ground/ 
     ---> discussion about the simplification of the environment and the availble information, how to get the information from
     the environment/ how these information is obtained in the simulation. For the purpose of data generation, the only thing
     we need is to get the data, we don't real care about if this information has access in the real world
     On the contrary, if RL is used for assertive control, all the observations/states should be available with the help of 
     different sensors.
